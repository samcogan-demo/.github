Contributing to samcogan-demo
=============================

Thanks for your interest in contributing to `samcogan-demo` projects. This file
provides a short guide to help you get started.

Getting Started
- Look for a repository under the `samcogan-demo` org that you'd like to
  contribute to and read its README for project-specific setup.
- Check open issues or open a new issue to propose a change or request help.

Filing Issues
- Use a clear title and describe the problem or feature request with steps to
  reproduce, expected behavior, and actual behavior.
- Tag the issue appropriately (bug, enhancement, question).

Pull Requests
- Fork the repository and create a topic branch named with a short, descriptive
  name (e.g., `fix/typo-readme` or `feat/add-auth`).
- Keep changes small and focused; one change per PR when practical.
- Include tests or steps to verify your change when appropriate.
- Reference related issues in the PR description (e.g., "Fixes #123").

Code Style & Tests
- Follow the project's existing coding style. If the project has a linter or
  formatter, run it before submitting your PR.
- Add or update tests when adding features or fixing bugs.

Review Process
- Maintainers will review PRs and may request changes. Please respond to
  feedback and update your branch.
- Merge is done by maintainers once CI passes and reviews are complete.

Communication
- For sensitive topics (security, harassment), follow the reporting instructions
  in the `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.

Thank you for contributing!
